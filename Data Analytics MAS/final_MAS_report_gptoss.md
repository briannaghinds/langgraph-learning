## 1. Executive Summary

- **Objective:** Briefly state the purpose of the analysis (e.g., “To understand customer churn patterns in Q1 2025”).  
- **Key Findings:**  
  - Finding 1 (e.g., “The average churn rate is 12 %”).  
  - Finding 2 (e.g., “Customers in the 25‑34 age group churn 1.5× more than other groups”).  
- **Recommendations:**  
  - Recommendation 1 (e.g., “Target retention campaigns at high‑risk segments”).  
  - Recommendation 2 (e.g., “Improve onboarding for new users to reduce churn”).

## 4. Visualisations

> **How to embed images**  
> Save each plot as a PNG/JPG and place it in the `images/` folder.  
> Use the Markdown syntax `![Alt Text](images/plot.png)`.

| Plot | Description |
|------|-------------|
| ![Churn Rate by Age Group](images/churn_by_age.png) | Bar chart showing churn rate across age brackets. |
| ![Monthly Spend Distribution](images/spend_distribution.png) | Histogram of monthly spend. |
| ![Cohort Analysis](images/cohort.png) | Line chart of retention over time by signup cohort. |
| ![Correlation Heatmap](images/corr_heatmap.png) | Heatmap of pairwise correlations. |

> **Tip:** Add captions and brief interpretations directly below each image.

## 5. Insights & Recommendations

| Insight | Evidence | Recommendation |
|---------|----------|----------------|
| **High churn among 25‑34 year olds** | 12 % churn vs. 7 % overall | Target retention emails with personalized offers. |
| **Monthly spend is highly skewed** | 90th percentile > 3× median | Offer tiered pricing or loyalty rewards for high spenders. |
| **Gender imbalance** | 70 % male | Review marketing channels to reach under‑represented groups. |
| *…* | *…* | *…* |

> **Action Plan**  
> 1. **Short‑term** – Launch a pilot retention campaign for the 25‑34 cohort.  
> 2. **Medium‑term** – Implement a loyalty program for top spenders.  
> 3. **Long‑term** – Conduct A/B tests on onboarding flows to reduce churn.

### How to Use This Template

1. **Replace placeholders** (`{{...}}`) with actual values from your analysis.  
2. **Generate visualisations** using your preferred library (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, etc.) and save them in the `images/` folder.  
3. **Copy the Markdown** into your reporting tool or GitHub README.  
4. **Review** the executive summary and insights to ensure they align with stakeholder expectations.
